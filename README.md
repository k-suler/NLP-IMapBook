Collaborative response writing (CREW) data contains a discussion data (CREW data tab) whose result was a final response (CREW final responses tab). Apart from this setting discussion only without final collaborative response is available (Discussion only data) to compare settings.

This project implements different ml algorithms for classification.

- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- Logistic regression
- Neural network
- Multi layered perceptron and
- Deep neural network
