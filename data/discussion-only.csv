And Part 2) What sort of prototypes should be considered for a resilient future?,Book Club One,pim-02,"The perspective of design has to be reimagined in this era of Covid-19 and global warming.  These are no longer the plots of a fictional movie or a conspiracy theory.

If we continue farming and producing emissions at the current rate there may not be a future. The design perspective is needed to think outside the box to create solutions for our current situations. The ever-growing population needs continue to rise. 2) Prototype for the future need to be ""green"" using less waste and less space.

At this time designers have begun addressing the needs of individuals in the current COVID climate.  2) Designs can arguably be measured on their permanence of impact and existence. Small circles in the park to encourage social distancing are low cost and easily removed. Designing new buildings to accommodate working from home, is more expensive and not quick to build or easy to pivot away from. Finding a balance is ",Content Discussion,22.11.2020 16:36,false,11
