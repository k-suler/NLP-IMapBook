35,1,,1,1,"Part 1: Ultimately, it is left for the reader to decide what is behind the door, and it would depend what they feel the princess cares about more - his life or him being married to another woman.
He sentences her to the same trial.
^Gina, that is a really interesting point that you make, that he sentences the princess to the same trial that he is on. The text describes the anxiety of being in a huge stadium with a roaring crowd and the fear of being killed horribly by a tiger, but at the same time, as you stated, the princess is herself in a greater trial than the man in that she has to decide whether to kill or not kill her lover who has hurt so deeply. That's a really insightful point, Gina! I hadn't thought of when I read the piece for the first time.

11,3,,2,25,"We feel that the reporter would be left to stew uncomfortably, awaiting Maier's return. Maier did state that he would return. Saudia suggessted that Maier would be returning with and using the experience to teach the reporter a lesson. This might be by making a statement. Zac Posen has a much more flamboyant style. Also, the aesthetics of the reporter's notepad and pen may have been off-putting to Maier. Taken together, this would not have been acceptable to Maier's sense of style."
21,3,,4,35,"1. The article discusses the way in which design always looks forward. The problem is that designers tend to design towards a future that is better where we have the same resources and less/similar problems. For example, the previous design models helped to feed the cause of the COVID pandemic. As the article stated, city designs (where people are stacked on top of each other in small, expensive housing) is not sustainable and contributed to the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, when design tries to solve one problem (in this case, overpopulation), it can cause others. Now, midst the COVID pandemic, it's become somewhat of a Catch-22 because the more we try to socially distance, the more space we will need. If humans continue to spread out in unsustainable ways, then nature will suffer and lead to more natural catastrophes. 2. Designers for the future must take into consideration many factors that they may not have previously. As we're faced with climate change and catastrophes caused by this kind of design, designers have to start designing towards a future bent on sustainability. We should consider prototypes that will create a sustainable future in quantifiable steps that have a widespread effect and won't leave people in urban areas or people in poverty behind. One way to look forward to a sustainable future is to study the designs of marginalized populations. For example, Julia Watson, urban designer and activist seeks answers from Indigenous people around the world because of their long practice in handling climatological disasters and other unforeseen events. One way to invest in our future is to recruit, support, and mentor designers from marginalized communities with perspectives most mainstream designers don't have. Additionally, designers of the future might have to actually look at ways to use less technology more proactively, since sometimes technology can cause more problems than it solves."
51,3,,3,3,"Upon the realization, the room was locked, the narrator began to panic. This was supposed to be a simple interview, not an escape room. He began to bang on the door but there was no response. Without his cell phone he was trapped with no way to call for help. The sleek lines of room revealed no apparent intercom, no way to call for help. He further inspected the gray inset of the walls and noticed they also had a spot for a person to place their fingers. They seemed to be just the perfect size for someone's fingertips. Maier didn't seem like the type to take kindly to someone messing with his stuff. He wondered do the walls open? Are there drawers? What could be inside these gray insets? They had to have a purpose otherwise they wouldn't exist. ""Zac Posen would never put me through this,"" he thought with a sigh."
12,4,,3,35,"Just when I thought I would never get out of that room, Maier came barging back inside.
""Zac Posen is exactly what the fashion design industry needs right now. He's taking minimalism to a whole new level with his genderless, basic white shirts and black bottoms.""
In his hands he held a recent New York magazine which profiled Zac Posen on the front cover. The article was what had prompted my intervew of Mr. Posen as he continues to rise to fame.
""Sorry for the delay. I was looking for this cover story so we could discuss it,"" Maier said.
""Not to worry. In fact, this article is the very reason I interviewed Zac Posen recently,"" I noted, ""but I am curious of your thoughts. Mr. Posen told me that his next collection will be more ornate, more colorful, more gaudy. This is quite a drastic move away from his more sudued style, don't you agree?""
Maier fixated on the cover of the magazine. Then, rather vehemntly, he cried, ""Simple design is always complicated. What Zac Posen is about to do is just tacky. No, no...this simply will not do!"" And he rushed out of the room again, leaving me trapped inside.
Again I waited and it felt like forever. Suddenly Maier came rushing back into the room with an arm full of new designs. ""This! This is what the design world needs right now!"" He showed me the first few designs he was holding and I was astounded.
The models in his new designs were essentially nude - except for a few pieces of minimalist jewelry and Maier's treasured sack of a handbag.
""This! This is where we need to move - strip it all away!"" he said.
With that, I decided I had better ways to use my time. I packed up my things and said, ""Well, thank you so much for your time. Where's the nearest exit? Goodbye.
"
25,4,,3,35,"Part 1.This article relates to the design perspective, becuase in the world of COVID-19, design is more important than ever. Housing in cities has been designed in the past to put as many people as possible into a very small space. this has created a problem with COVID being spread in gatherings of people less than 6 feet apart. This should be considered in the future, as it seems that Covid may not be going away anytime soon. I liked the example in the article about the fact that people are going to start wanting bunkers instead of apartments and farming their food instead of purchasing it. I thought that was an interesting prediction, and one I have been seeing come true amongst family members. Another way in which this article relates to the design perspective is that it works to question what, exactly, design is, discussing the broadness of the term and whether or not design is fundamentally an individual or collaborative act while discussing how design, while looking towards the future, also needs to consider the regrets of the past, focusing on learning from mistakes and building sustainable ways to build forward rather than coming up with needlessly and uselessly twee ideas or perpetuating the current flawed system, pointing out how COVID spreads in part because of structures and systems designed with sort-term gain rather than public health in mind for example.
Part 2. For a resilient future, prototypes should be focused on finding ways to allow people to interact while still being safe from spreading illnesses. This has become a large focus due to the negative impact that COVID-19 has had on not only the economy, but also on societal relationships. There will also be a continuation to find methods to promote green efforts and reduce the carbon footprint as illustrated with the move to solar enegry in many areas an companies, like Amazon, who are making plans to transition their fleets to electric over the next several years. There will also be a trend towards more self-sustaining farming with new ways to allow people to grow plants even in a suburban setting where there is minimal extra space for such ventures. These prototypes should also work to be willing to learn from the past, noting what designs have failed to do what needs to be done rather than continuing along poorly concieved paths, and they should be focused on pratical pursuits rather than risking pursuits that end up designed, to paraphrase the article, for futures that never come to pass. They should also be built in a way that doesn't make unneccesary compromises to its core ideals, such as the planned ""utopian"" city that ended up falling through becuase their plans to do so involved destroying the enviroment they claimed to want to save
"
42,4,,4,4,"Part 1 : Why does the article content relate to the design perspective?
Upon reading the article, “CREW Design for Future when Future Bleak,” one can instantly make the connection between design and environmental dangers, especially man-made ones. Humans have undoubtedly contributed positive and pragmatic solutions to the everyday problems we face; however, we are also the cause of the problems, if not the catalyst that has magnified these. The article talks about urban and rural designs and how perhaps without us realizing it, influence (and vice versa) the way we relate to the world and to each other.
For example, the process of farming contributes to how we relate to food, poverty, malnutrition, animals, disease, etc.; the architecture in urban areas program us to relate to technology, communication, even our own identities in a transformative way. Specifically referring to Covid-19, the article touched on a factual piece of information which proves that this pandemic will not be the last mass threat to human life or our experience with quarantine, “Covid-19 is, after all, a zoonotic disease, like SARS or Ebola, and it is the result of habitat destruction, of animals that humans shouldn’t be in contact with getting too close to our livestock as a result of over-farming and development — problems in which design has played no small part.” The entitlement, intrusiveness, and negligence through which we raid, dominate, and abuse the natural environment has always had consequences, but through the years, our carbon footprint has exponentially grown and fatally affected the livelihood of living organisms of which we thought were inconsequential. However, Covid-19 shattered the false sense of security and the master narrative we told ourselves as we continued to pillage.
As a society, we need to move forward with humility and purpose if are planning on extending life on earth. Our individual safety and liberties depend on our treatment of others, not just humans. As Brand said, “[humans are responsible to live up to the] power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his own adventure with whoever is interested.” Although saving the planet and living sustainably is a collective effort, Brand highlights the power and boldness one individual has to change the world, to be unconventional, and combine practical engineering with creative thinking to design a world worth saving.
Part 2: What sort of prototypes should be considered for a resilient future?As we begin to evaluate and contribute to a solution for a more resilient future for all beings we must consider conveniences we have designed that can be eliminated. The article speaks about how we have moved far away from a life of necessity into a life of what is fastest and most convenient. ""Design, like planning, was the profession most concerned with the future. Today is not so different, but what we mean by “the future,” a utopian ideal throughout much of the 20th century, is now undeniably much darker as we progress further into the 21st. To look ahead at what role design will play on an increasingly troubled planet takes us back to the fundamental polysemy behind the word itself. "" We must reimagine the role of design and make a quick and valuable prototype that helps us to correct the ""regrets"" of our past. Our prototypes must include change and corrective action to the normalcies designed for our current world that have engaged and extended a path of danger and darkness causing this more bleak future we envision today. Extending our solutions to contribute to a utopian existence for all versus one for just humans. It is important that we use design to improve on the way we currently live but be open minded to the changes needed to allow for our existence to be more sustainable. Our response to Covid has shown that we can in fact re-design our current world in a way that we respond to different issues that face our communities and our world as a whole. Collaboration of lifestyles from all over the world can allow us to find trends and positive lifestyle design that can ignite a brighter view of the future. ""Lo-TEK imagines that the knowledge of how to survive the future is already embedded in low-energy, often ancient practices."" We can take the lessons of yesterday and today then combine it with varied approaches to life to create a prototype that truly creates a future of hope and beauty leading us to a life of meaning and positive influence. This article made me think of visiting EPCOT in their living with the land experience. Farming has come a long way. Seeing all the ways that they are planting vertically and using a track system instead of just farming horizontally on the ground is amazing. By farming that way, any extra water that was dropping from the vertical planters were being deposited on the plants below. It's a great example of what Ditzler was saying in the article, “how to feed everyone on this overloaded globe, and how to do it in a way that doesn’t render the earth uninhabitable.” We need more prototypes like these to have a more resilient future. COVID has changed the ways that we are living and thinking. People are being more creative with everyday life. During the quarantine people started planting their own gardens and making more of outdoor living spaces. I liked how the article referenced how a pizzeria in Italy stayed open by offering slices through a window. Here in the US bars are being forced to stay closed unless they are selling food. This has created a need for food trucks that otherwise might not have a place to open. These relationships are keeping businesses open and saving our economy. These might just be small scale changes like the article mentions. We need more forward thinkers to help put in place large scale initiatives.
"
63,4,,4,4,"Part 1: Why does the article content relate to the design perspective?
It is all about design, but design with a much wider scope than things like furniture and the ""arrangement of interior space"" as the article describes it. This is about designing for the future,
designing to cope with futuristic (or not so futuristic now) problems like climate change and pandemics. In design, it is difficult to design to a future that does not exist, when designs may cease to be relevant in our future climate and culture.
Part 2: What sort of prototypes should be considered for a resilient future?
Billy Fleming, director of U Penn's McHarg Center, says that for a resilient future, ""We don't need playful design proposals. We need high-impact built projects."" An example from this article is Ian McHarg's 1974 Woodlands Community, ""organized around restoring and protecting the area's water cycles,"" with a mixed-income population.
Our collaborative discussion in this instance focused on prototypes for life and education in a COVID-impacted environment. We asked, with the onset of biological, climate and political unrest, where does typical learning occur? Remote learning for children is difficult to sustain, with considerations of supervision, technical accommodations, and parents who need to work. Depending on the location, there may also be requirements for children to attend in-person school. We present a high-impact prototype designed to address fears of contagious disease while facilitating ease of learning and communication.
The Health Information Technology System (HITS) helmet is full-faced head gear with 5G to connect to networks and send/receive communication from teachers, students and peers. HITS reports real-time vitals (temps, heart rate, eye movements, etc.) and is enhanced with augmented reality (AR) features. AR assets would be tagged by authorized users, submitted and hosted online (think ""Cyber Congressional Library"") for HITS to display the AR overlays. For schoolchildren, imagine field trips with the learners scanning objects in AR using the helmet, to include GEO tracking, proximity alerts, and warnings such as elevated temperature.
Head gear with respiratory function exists in a military context, for example as seen here: https://www.army.mil/article/125327/Army_designing_next_generation_protective_mask/ A more child-friendly design is envisioned for this prototype. An example of an AR interface with proximity warning is here: https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*MqJFT-uDEa1-Crmv.png

52,,2,3,25,"After another hour of wandering the uninteresting minimalist room, he decided to try the door again, still with no luck. He continued to place his fingers in the depressions of the heavy stainless door and pull, pull, pull. The door did not budge an inch. Finally, after another hour and more pulling at the door, he frustratedly kicked at the door. It swung open easily. An instance of dealing with nonintuitive design! The handle design said, ""pull me,"" but the door required that you push it to open it from that side."
43,1,2,,15,"The article relates to design perspective because it describes how the different things happening relate and interact within a community and environment.
Prototypes that have the ability to improve how we live would help to create a more resilient future. We are going to need to create structures that can support the changing climate and weather.
I completely agree with your response for part 1 and 2. The article talks about how design is connected/impacted/related to what is happening around us. Prototypes such as multi-functional buildings/spaces should be concerned for a resilient future.
"
53,2,2,,2,"I paced around the room some more hoping to find some clue of how to get out of here, or at the very least a way to communicate with someone. The minimal aesthetic left me empty and void of ideas. The painting on the wall stared back at me. It's Arctic lanscape was as minimal as the room and as cold as Tomas. Staring more at the Artic wastland in front of me, the details that hid themselves started to ignite ideas of how to escape this room. Even though they were hidden, the details were there the whole time in the painting, I just needed to recognize them. What details am I missing within this room that I occupy? Are these the key to my escape? Minimalistic the aesthtics may be, but lacking in design they are not."
14,3,2,,25,"A feeling of panic washed over me. Perhaps my mention of Zac Posen set him off? They don't exactly share the same ideologies when it comes to design. I look around the sleek room and notice a small button that blends into the wall. I take a step forward to examine it more closely. As I reach forward to touch it, I lose my balance and press it instead. A panel in the wall slides open like a secret door in a sci-fi film. Peeking through, I see a room exactly like the one I had just vacated, complete with another button on the opposite wall. I continue forward and there is room upon room of emptiness until finally, the last button is glowing. I look around and wonder if I'm truly supposed to be here and then press the final button. This final room is brightly light with drawers and hanging rails lining the walls. Sitting on an ottoman in the middle of the enormous closet is Tomas Maier. He stands and spreads his hands, ""Do you understand now?"""
15,,3,2,25,"Hi Mercedes. Here are some thoughs on ""What happens next"":
Thoughts on what happens next: Wow, I know that designers tend to be a bit quirky, but his guy is done right weird. Not only do I not know exactly how long I've been in here since he took my smart phone, I also have no foreseeable way out! Did I offend him? He left right after I mentioned Zac Posen. Maybe he hates Zac Posen - or Target!? Who knows, this guy is an enigma.
Just then, Maier walked back in - with none other than Zac Posen himself. ""I believe you two have met?"" he said dryly. ""Hey, nice to see you again,"" said Posen. ""Mr. Posen,"" I started. ""Please, call me Zac."" ""Zac,"" I said. ""What a suprise. Not to see you in Milan during Fashion Week, of course, but in this rather bizarre, fortress-like setting,"" I said, raising an eyebrow at Maier.
""Oh, yes, sorry about that,"" said Maier. ""Couldn't be helped. The label is quite secretive about our new coloboration."" ""New colaboration?"" I asked. ""Yeah,"" said Posen. ""We're working together on a new sustainable clothing collection.""
""Very hush, hush,"" said Maier. ""It will be debuting this week. I trust that in return for an exclusive we can rely on you to keep our secret until after the runway on Thursday?""
Two hours later, I left the building with the makings of a piece that would tell of the building of a new brand - an insdier's view from two legends in the industry, and a story that, if I played my cards right, could put me on the map in fashion journalism.
Kim
Kim, I love your take on what happens next.
Mercedes
Great. I'm leaving work now and will log back in at 8:00. Think about if there is anything else you'd like to add or change. I'm certainly open to both. We can talk and then submit.
Honestly, I like where you took to the story. I can see that happening in the fashion industry. Fashion designers rely on journalism to make their products seem exclusive, and then they can charge a hefty price.
OK, sounds great. We can go ahead and submit it.
I'm not sure about the whole ""Send Message"" component. It didn't add all of the text so I will add it below. And then add Submitted to the Send Message

OK - all submitted. I think there is a second part next week, so maybe we'll be paired up again then!
"
22,,3,4,35,"1. Why does the article content relate to the design perspective?
The article relates to the design perspective because design is always needing to evolve with the world around us. As the pandemic has changed so many aspects of life, design perspective must change along with it.
I agree, the design perspective requires flexibility to accommodate the constantly changing world. The pandemic has changed many aspects of life commanding the design perspective to change along with it.
I found it interesting when a lot of the world was shut down how many cities had cleared of smog and pollution.
Oh, agreed! I found it interesting that although many day-to-day driving stopped and home deliveries skyrocketed, the pollution still lessened.
2. What sort of prototypes should be considered for a resilient future?
Prototypes for the future need to involve both sustainable energies and potentially designs that may reverse the current damages we are doing. With the way things are going, the environment must be a huge factor in considering design for a resilient future.
As far as prototypes that should be considered for a resilient future, I suggest using things such as vertical farming or aquatic farming would be beneficial in helping keep farmland, animals, and non-farming creatures in separated areas.
Those are great examples. I think concepts based on using renewable energies should be considered for all buildings going forward. Solar and wind power abilities automatically built into the design.
"
44,,3,4,35,"Part 1: Design is the idea of planning the future, but how do we design for a troubled planet? Why should we keep planning for a future that does not exist? The article and its subject are designed to send a message about the gradual deterioration of the global environment. They work hard to amplify the warnings that we have been receiving about global warming, litter filling multiple natural biomes (i.e. oceans, forests, etc.), and other environmental problems that we are currently facing. How the article and its subject are received will depend on the public. They both have been thoughtfully been put together, but we as a society have to make changes to ensure our planets survival.
Part 2: According to the article, ""large-scale initiatives"" need to be considered for a resilient future. Right now, we are living in a dystopian design after COVID 19, and now we need to figure out how to survive and make our lives better through design. We should acknowledge that we are a society that is is divided, unjust, prejudice, and unequal in language, geography, and class. The article points out we need to solve over farming and development, so humans are not coming into close contact with animals they should not be around. In an effort to design for comfort, we have destroyed our natural environment. Now, we are looking at design based on infection levels. Design is leaning towards self-sufficiency, private farming, and many people are moving out of the cities. Apartment living with close proximity to neighbors is on a decline.
"
23,4,3,,35,"I work for the Engineering department of Pasco County. We deal a lot with design. Just today, I took a ride out to a jobsite that is building an easier access to the Suncoast Parkway, which ideally...sounds great. However, this road is intersecting with wetlands. Environmentally, this is heartbreaking. We are taking more away from the beautiful Earth we are given. I believe this article relates to design because we are designing the future and planet we are living on for the rest of not only our lives, but for generations to come. I believe prototypes that should be considered is eliminating the need for instant gratification and instead looking at the bigger picture. People need to stop being greedy, and look at what they already have. We don't need more and more buildings. We need to go outside more, and appreciate fresh air while it is still ""fresh"" (depending on where you live). Society needs to eliminate or strongly lessen the use of plastics. Think of how we were given the Earth, and look what we've done to it. Look at the animals we've lost, the environments and habitats we've destroyed due to our own greed. We share land with these animals. We are not more important than them. This all can be seen from the ""design"" perspective. We are designing every day with every choice we make.
This article reminds me of a statistic I saw the other day. The United States census states that 10.1 percent of houses are vacant in 2020. This only accounts for residential dwellings so imagine all the shops and other buildings that sit unused while new structures are being built every day. If we repurpose these empty buildings to fit the needs of our growing society we would find that we have the structures already in place to create adequate housing for all. Rather than building new buildings, we can outfit the ones we have with sustainable energy sources such as solar panels to create a resilient future.
Does anyone have any ideas about how to combine our ideas to create one answer to submit?
"
31,,4,4,4,"Part 1
The story regularly emphasizes the barbaric nature of the princess, and I assume that this emphasis suggests that the princess directs her lover to the tiger's door. It's implying that she would be less selfless and more ruthless. So, as the man reached for the tiger's door the princess exhaled, knowing that she would emerge the victor. Her lover would die and never love another. The lady, who the princess wasn't fond of, was not to have the happy ending either.
Part 2
The king is so enraged by his daughter's defiance that he has no choice but to follow the protocol he had previously established. She opens the door and is met with the same fate as her lover.
"
32,,4,4,4,"Our group is in agreement that due to the princesses' thought process and her semi-barbaric lineage she would most likely send her lover to the door with the tiger. Additionally, she was extremely jealous of the lady behind the door. Surely, a semi-barbaric princess would rather her lover not run into the arms of another woman. Though she must live without him either way, our group feels that she would rather him dead than be with someone else because her concerns were her own jealousy rather than his death.
Our group also feels that the king would not send his precious princess to suffer the judgement of the arena. Thus, he may, instead, send her informant to the arena as a punishment for his betrayal. Another idea that we feel would be best is that this would give the king a great opportunity to discontinue the unfair use of this system. By not sending his daughter to the arena, he may realize the unfairness of his system and thus make a major change that would help progress his kingdom.
"
34,,4,4,4,"Her face was a mask of indifference as the young man moved without hesitation to the door on the right, but pain welled up inside of her as she watched the back of her lover. Had she made the correct choice? Whether or not it was the right one, she had made it and had to live with the consequence.
The door opened and out sprang the vicious beast, flashing claws and glistening fangs unleashed upon the youth she had loved so dearly. She imagined that she was that tiger, shredding his flesh to ribbons as the crowd cheered. All the rage and pain of the last sleepless nights unbound and freed right before her. It made her sick, but this was what she had decided. This was the result her love had come to because of her jealousy and her anger. Yet, he had trusted her.
It was that thought that brought her to turn to her father who was watching her expressions carefully. ""I knew which door the beast was behind,"" she confessed, her pain still masked behind a strong facade. ""I broke the sacred law. I too should be put to trial,"" she said turning her gaze back to the beast that feasted on the bloody carcass of the young man whose blood stained the rough earth.
The King's eyes changed from rapt interest in the scene before him, to dread, then indifference. His usual cold demeanor wavering for only a moment. His own daughter? How could this be? But he knew what must be done. The tradition of the land must be upheld, no matter the cost.
A public notice was released at once. The princess would be held accountable for her egregious actions the following afternoon in the arena, with the whole kingdom in attendance.
The morning of the trial arrived. The King met the princess in her quarters. ""My daughter. For you, I have chosen a most suitable husband. A prince from the neighboring land renowned for his loyalty to the throne and prowess on the battlegrounds. It would be for shame should you not choose the 'right' door,"" he said with a knowing glance. ""We shall meet in the arena at high noon.""
The Princess could hear the jeers of the crowd the the stands above her, all anxious for her judement to come. Would they see their princess swept away in the arms of a lover or ravaged by the ferocious beast? In the next moments, her fate would be decided. Her father would be watching from his throne, a calculating expression upon his face. She knew what she was to do.
Calmly entering the arena, the Princess stood where just yesterday, her lover lay in pieces. The crowd was silent. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw her father seated calmly and staring blankly ahead. With a deep breath, she made her choice.
""I'm coming, my love,"" she whispered to herself, as she walked to the door on the left and the world went dark.
"
62,,4,4,4,"The article content relates to the design perspective as it considers the evolution of what design is understood to encompass. It expands upon the idea of design being merely the arrangement and placement of objects or attention to aesthetic appeal and provides examples that design is a solution and reflection of the world around it. In fact, good design should take into account all aspects of reality and adapt to both the times and environment. In order to prepare us for a resilient future, it is neccessary to take into account the full context and implications of all aspects of the design decision. Prototypes for a resilient future should make a product useful, innovative, and unobstrative, while prioritizing quality and timeless aspects. The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness as not only are well-executed objects beautiful, their attributes ensure that they will find a place in the future. I would suggest that to create a resilient prototype, the design should be both neutral and restrainted to leave room for the viewer's self expression and never appear antiquated.
The difficulty in design, which is well defined above, is that it is often difficult to see beyond the ""now"" to know what may be useful and innnovative in the future. Consider designs that were generally scoffed at when they they were invented, but which continue to have a place in this technological age (bicycles, automobiles, nail polish, cheesburgers, talking pictures, answering machines, laptop computers). Also consider the other side of the coin, inventions that were expected to make a huge impact on society, but quietly disappeared and were forgotten (8-track, ThoRadia-radioactive health products, laserdisc, flying tank, segway, windows vista, 3d TV, google glass). In some ways design is akin to gambling, literature, and fine art success is often unpredictable.
